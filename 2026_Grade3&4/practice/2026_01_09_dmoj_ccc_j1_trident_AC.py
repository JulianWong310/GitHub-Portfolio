A trident is a fork with three tines (prongs).
A simple picture of a trident can be made from asterisks and spaces:

*  *  *
*  *  *
*  *  *
*******
   *
   *
   *
   *
In this example, each tine is a vertical column of 3 asterisks.
Each tine is separated by 2 spaces.
The handle is a vertical column of 4 asterisks below the middle tine.
Tridents of various shapes can be drawn by varying three parameters:
t, the height of the tines,
s, the spacing between tines, and
h, the length of the handle. For the example above we have
t=3, s=2, and h=4

You are to write an interactive program to print a trident.
Your program should accept as input the parameters
t,s,and h and print the appropriate trident. You can assume that
t,s,h are each at least 0 and not larger than 10.
