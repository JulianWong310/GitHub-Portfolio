<summary><strong>Project Description</strong></summary>
This project is a robot made with mBot2, CyberPi, and Makeblock Python.
The robot can follow a black line on the ground.
It uses a Quad RGB sensor to see the line.
It also uses an ultrasonic sensor to find obstacles.
When the robot sees an obstacle, it turns away.

I spent a lot of time testing and fixing the code.
After many real-world tests, the robot works very well.

Features
- Follows a black line using the Quad RGB Sensor (L1, L2, R1, R2)
- Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles
- Starts when Button A on CyberPi is pressed
- Avoids obstacles before following the line
