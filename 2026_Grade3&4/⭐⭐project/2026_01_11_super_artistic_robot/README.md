My Super Artistic Robot

Hi there! Welcome to my Super Artistic Robot! I created this cool program to draw awesome shapes using code. It’s like a magic printer that lives inside my computer!

What can this robot do?
My robot is a master artist. You can ask it to paint 4 different things:

BOWTIE (h = 5)
```text
*       *
***   ***
*********
***   ***
*       *
```
DIAMOND (h = 5)
```text
  *  
 *** 
*****
 *** 
  *  
```
HOURGLASS (h = 5)
```text
*******
 *****
  ***
 *****
*******
```
TRIDENT (t = 4, s = 3, h = 2)
```text
*   *   *
*   *   *
*   *   *
*   *   *
*********
    *
    *
```
How to play with my Robot:
Run the code: The robot will say "Welcome to Super Artistic Robot" and show you a menu.

Pick a number: Type a number from 1 to 4 to choose what to draw.

Give it a size: For the Bowtie, Diamond, and Hourglass, give it an odd number (like 5, 7, or 9).

For the Trident, you get to choose how long the tines are, how much space they have, and how long the handle is!

See the magic: The robot prints your art instantly!

Exit: When you are done, just type 5 and the robot will say "Goodbye!"

My "Secret Formula" (How I made it)
I used Python to build this. My favorite part was figuring out the math for the spaces and stars.

I used for loops so the robot knows how to count the rows.

I used input() so I can talk to my robot.

I even put it in a while True loop so it never stops painting until I say so!

Self-Reflection:
I'm really proud that I could merge all my drawings into one big Super Robot. It makes the code much cleaner and easier to use.

My favorite new feature is the Exit Button! I learned how to use the break command. Before, my robot would keep asking for drawings forever, but now, when you choose option 5, the break tells the computer: "Stop the loop right now, we are done!" It's like giving my robot a real Power-Off switch.

Next time, I might teach my robot how to draw a star or even a secret pattern!
Hope you enjoy my art! 

Have a wonderful day! ☀️
