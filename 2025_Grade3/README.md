# 2025 Python Portfolio

This folder contains my Python learning work from 2025.
It includes small projects and practice exercises as I began learning Python.

## Projects
Small projects where I applied what I learned:

- [Drawing a Blanket Pattern with Turtle](https://github.com/JulianWong310/GitHub-Portfolio/tree/main/2025_Grade3/%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90project/2025-12-03%20Python_Turtle_Pattern_Blanket)  
  → using loops and patterns to draw shapes with Turtle

- [MBot2 Track Maneuver](https://github.com/JulianWong310/GitHub-Portfolio/tree/main/2025_Grade3/%E2%AD%90%E2%AD%90project/2025-12-24%20Python_MBot2_Track_Maneuver)  
  → controlling a robot with sensors and color-based actions
