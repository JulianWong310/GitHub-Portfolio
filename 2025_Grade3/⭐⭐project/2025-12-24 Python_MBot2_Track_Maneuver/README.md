<summary><strong>🧠 My Thinking</strong></summary>

- I stop on red because it means danger.
- I slow down on yellow to be careful.
- I turn around on green to change direction.
- I speed up on blue to test fast movement.
- I use sleep() so actions can finish clearly.
- Next, I want to make the turns smoother.
