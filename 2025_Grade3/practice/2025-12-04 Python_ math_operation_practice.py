Python Math Operator Practice
🎯 Simple Rule
👉 Use + − * / for normal math
👉 Use // to drop decimals
👉 Use % to get remainders
👉 Use ** to do powers
"""
# Practice 1: Addition
# Create two variables and add them together.
x=60
v=7
z=x+v
print(z)

# Practice 2: Subtraction
# Make two numbers and subtract.
t=70
k=3
r=t-k
print(r)

#Practice 3: Multiplication
# Multiply two numbers.
r=1
s=67
print(r*s)

# Practice 4: Division
# Divide two numbers and see the decimal result.
j=1
p=67
print(p/j)

# Practice 5: Floor Division (//)
# Find how many whole groups you can make.
o=4490
i=67
print(o//i)

# Practice 6: Modulo (%)
# Find the remainder.
x=4691
v=68
print(x%v)

# Practice 7: Even or Odd
# Use % to check if a number is even or odd.
q=67
if q%2==0:
    print("it is even")
else:
    print("it is odd")

#Practice 8: Exponent ( )**
# Write a power (like 2³).
y=67
x=1
print(y**x)

# Practice 9: Mixed Story Problem
# Write code for this story:
# You have 97 apples.
# You share them with 6 friends.
# How many apples does each friend get?
# How many apples are left?
w=97
l=6
x=1
print(w//l)
print(w%l)

# Practice 10: Make Your Own
# Create your own math problem using any operator and solve it with Python.
# Calvin has 4489 presents.
# Calvin gives presents to 67 kids
# How many presents will each kid get?
d=4489
n=67
