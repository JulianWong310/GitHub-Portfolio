### 📝 Part 1: The Three Golden Rules

**Q1. The Chain Rule Application** If $7$ divides $n$ and $n$ divides $140$, which of the following is **NOT** a possible value for $n$?  
(A) 7  
(B) 14  
(C) 20  
(D) 70  

**Q2. The Addition/Subtraction Rule** Suppose a number $m$ divides both $48$ and $30$. According to the Addition/Subtraction Rule, $m$ must also divide which of the following?  
(A) 9  
(B) 12  
(C) 18  
(D) 20  

**Q3. The Combo Rule (Linear Combination)** If $m$ divides $a$ and $m$ divides $b$, the Combo Rule states $m$ divides any "combo" like $qa + rb$. If $5|a$ and $5|b$, which of these is definitely divisible by 5?  
(A) $a + b + 1$  
(B) $3a + 2b$  
(C) $a - b + 2$  
(D) $2a + b - 3$

**Q4. The "n" Elimination Challenge** If a number $m$ divides $(n + 2)$ and $m$ also divides $(n + 10)$, what is the largest possible value for the integer $m$?  
(A) 2  
(B) 4  
(C) 8  
(D) 10  

**Q5. Logic Check** If $m|15$ and $m|25$, which of the following must be true?  
(A) $m$ must be 5  
(B) $m$ must divide 10  
(C) $m$ must divide 40  
(D) Both (B) and (C) are true
