# 🔑 Answer Key

| Question | Answer | Reason (Based on Logic) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Q1** | **A** | $46 - 4 = 42$. Since $7$ divides $42$, $7$ divides $462$. |
| **Q2** | **B** | The alternating sum $2-7+2-8$ is $-11$. |
| **Q3** | **B** | $5-0+1-6 = 0$. Since $11$ divides $0$, $11$ divides $5016$. |
| **Q4** | **A** | $16 + 36 = 52$. Since $13 \times 4 = 52$, it passes. |
| **Q5** | **A** | $29 + (9 \times 4) = 65$. Since $13 \times 5 = 65$, it passes. |
| **Q6** | **A** | $22 - 5 = 17$. $17$ divides $17$. |
| **Q7** | **A** | $45 - 45 = 0$. Since $17$ divides $0$, it passes. |
| **Q8** | **A** | $43 + 14 = 57$. Since $19 \times 3 = 57$, it passes. |
| **Q9** | **A** | $20 + 18 = 38$. Since $19 \times 2 = 38$, it passes. |
| **Q10** | **D** | All choices are multiples of $77$ ($7 \times 11$). |
